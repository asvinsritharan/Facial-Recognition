Detect human faces in an image

First select the folder which contains your training images of people you would like to add to the model

Then select the folder which contains the image of the person you would like to identify.
** This image must be in a different location that your training images **

Then the script will ask you to label each image.
  It will show you the image, you press any button while focused on the image window, then the image will disappear and you can label the person in the image
  The next picture will show once you finish typing the last person's name in the console and press enter. 
    Here you press any key while focused on the image window and you can select a number which corresponds to the name of the person in the image based on your previous labels, or you can press 0 to type a new person's name
    Hit enter once you are done and the next picture will appear, you proceed in the same way until all the pictures are labelled.
  ** Sometimes, the image window may appear but be minimized, be sure to check the taskbar to see if it appears there**

Once the images are labelled, it will show you the person in the image and output the name of the person in the console
